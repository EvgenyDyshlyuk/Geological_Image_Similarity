# Gelogical Image Similarity
**This is a personal ML project on [Geological Image Similarity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tanyadayanand/geological-image-similarity)**  

## BACKGROUND
A geology research company wants to create a tool for identifying interesting patterns in their imagery data. This tool
will possess a search capability whereby an analyst provides an image of interest and is presented with other images
which are similar to it.

## GOAL
Task is to create the machine learning component for this image similarity application. The machine learning
model should return the top K images that are most similar to this image based on a single image input.

## About the Data:
The data includes 6 different classes of 5000 28X28 RGB images (total of 29998 images)
